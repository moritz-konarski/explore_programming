# Preface

- created in 2007 at Google, unveiled in 2009
- supposed to be expressive, efficient, effective
- similarity to C, just updated
- leaves out features that make stuff too complex
- has automatic memory management
- suited for networked servers and tools for programmers, but general purpose
- Go tends to work better than untyped scripting languages -- a nice feature
- open source and generally portable between every single platform
- ALGOL, C, Pascal $\rightarrow$ Go
- it gets is syntax from C, concurrency from CSP
- agenda of radical simplicity -- a type system that is complex enough to be
safer, but not too complex to be a burden
- code has very little hidden memory allocations
- lightweight threads (_goroutines_) are cheap to create, but practical for
even large numbers
