# Variables and functions

## Variables

- variables are useful
```haskell
    a = 3.141592
    a^3
```
- code is more readable and modifiable


## Haskell source files

- file extension is `.hs`
- to load a file in GHCi type `:l`, to reload type `:r`

## Comments

- comments are done like this
```haskell
    x = 5       -- a comment
```
- block comments work like this
```haskell
    x = 5
    {-
        multi-line comment
    -}
    y = {- inline comment -} 12
```

## Variables in imperative languages

- in Haskell, variables can only be declared once and they are immutable

## Functions
